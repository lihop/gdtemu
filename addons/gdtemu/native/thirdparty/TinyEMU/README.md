# TinyEMU

This is a modified version of [Fabrice Bellard's TinyEMU][TinyEMU] which is
forked from [Fernando Lemos's version](https://github.com/fernandotcl/TinyEMU/).

This fork is primarily intended for use as a library by the [gdtemu plugin] for the [Godot game engine].

The `temu` executable will eventually be removed and calls to `exit()` replaced.
